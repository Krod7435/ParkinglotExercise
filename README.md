In this lab project, i worked with a practice scenario of working with an issue where i was a security professional at a hospital. My main issue i dealt with was an employee at the "Rhetorical Hospital" by the name of "Jorge" had dropped his flash drive on the ground in public.  My mission was to investigate it and write my observations from it.
